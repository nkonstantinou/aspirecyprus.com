Dr. Kambanaros is Associate Professor of Speech Pathology. She served as inaugural Chair of the then newly created Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and as former Dean (first- ever female) of the School of Health Sciences at the Cyprus University of Technology. Currently, she directs the Centre of Research on Neurological Communication Disorders & Rehabilitation, established on her initiative. With bachelor and doctoral degrees in speech pathology from the School of Medicine at Flinders University of South Australia, she is a certified bilingual English–Greek speech–language pathologist with over 30 years of clinical experience and academic appointments in Greece and Cyprus. The process of her promotion to Professor will begin on April 2nd 2017.
Dr. Kambanaros is an honorary member of the Greek Association of Speech Pathologists and Speech Therapists, Scientists of Greece and a regular member of major international speech– language therapists associations as well as the national ones in Cyprus, Australia, the UK, and the US. She is the author of a highly successful book on Diagnostic Issues in Speech Therapy, Διαγνωστικά Θέματα Λογοθεραπείας (Athens: ELLIN Publishing Co., 2007), which has been adopted as the standard university textbook in Speech and Language Therapy programmes in Greece and Cyprus with over 3,000 copies sold to date. She has supervised numerous undergraduate theses and sits on several master and doctoral committees. At present, she coordinates a new masters programme in Brain and Cognitive Sciences. The programme has received local and international students from diverse backgrounds such as artificial intelligence, linguistics, medicine, and psychology.
Dr. Kambanaros currently supervises four PhD students in the areas of diagnostics mainly cognitive-linguistic profiling of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and PPA (Primary Progressive Aphasia), and on the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on language recovery after stroke. She also co-supervised a postdoctoral research on a project investigating very early language development funded by the A.G. Leventis Foundation (LexiKyp Project).
Dr. Kambanaros is active in disseminating her research findings in international peer-reviewed journals with high impact factors, and her work has been featured in local and international media. She is the (co-)author of almost 70 articles in international peerreviewed journals and book chapters in international edited volumes. She has also presented her work in over 30 invited keynotes, lectures, and seminars in Europe, the Middle East, and Australia, and 80 oral and poster presentations at international conferences.
Dr. Kambanaros is highly committed to developing tools and valid diagnostic and therapeutic measures for assessing and rehabilitating language impairments from a range of diagnostic categories including aphasia after stroke particularly for deficits in naming and connected
  
speech. In the last decade, she has published 15 journal articles and 5 book chapters on language-related impairments after stroke in monolingual and bilingual speakers.
Dr. Kambanaros was a Management Committee member of the European research network COST Action IS0804 on SLI in bilingual children (http://www.bi-sli.org) and is currently involved in two further actions, COST Action IS0812 (http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/isch/Actions/IS1208), on aphasia rehabilitation of direct relevance to the proposed project, and COST Action IS1406 (http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/isch/Actions/IS1406), on language intervention. These collaborations have allowed her to fine-tune assessment and diagnostic tools to be used with Greek Cypriot speakers. This information has been made available to speech–language therapists employed by the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture.
Finally, Dr. Kambanaros has built up an extensive international network fostering strong collaborations. These include consulting services on research projects (Acquisition and the Syntax–Semantics Interface in Passives, Takachiho University, Tokyo, since 2015; Generative Childhood-Holistic Investigations of Language Development: Context Domain Specific Socio- Syntax of First Language Acquisition in Cypriot Greek, 2010–12), participation in local (Adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates CDI for Cypriot Greek: Development in Toddlers, Leventis Foundation/University of Cyprus, 2014–16; Early Identification and Assessment of Preschool Children with Specific Language Impairment in Cyprus, Research Promotion Foundation/University of Cyprus, 2011–12) and international projects beyond COST Actions (Cognitive and Linguistic Diversity across Mental Disorders: Typology, Behavioural Analysis and Neuroimaging, Universita Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, since 2017; Going beyond Verbal Fluency Tasks to Improve Diagnosis and Therapeutic Interventions in MCI Patients: An Electrophysiological Pilot Study, University of Adelaide, since 2016), Rehabilitation of Recovery of people with Aphasia after Stroke (RELEASE) project, National Institute of Health Research programme grant for Health Services and Delivery Research (NIHR; HS&DR Project: 14/04/22), and the Development of a core outcome set for use in an international, observational post-stroke aphasia study (International Practice-Based Rehabilitation approaches to AphasIa after StrokE [I-PRAISE]), University of Glasgow Caledonia that have a direct relevance to the proposed project.
