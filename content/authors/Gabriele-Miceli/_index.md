Prof. Miceli's research focuses on the neurofunctional correlates of language. He is interested in articulating increasingly detailed functional models of linguistic skills (auditory speech processing; writing; sentence comprehension/production), and in correlating such skills to increasingly specified neural substrates. Research involves participants with intact cognitive skills, as well as brain-damaged persons, including individuals undergoing awake surgery for gliomas.
